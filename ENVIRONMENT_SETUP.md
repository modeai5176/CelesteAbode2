## Important Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Restart your development server after creating the file
- All environment variables are automatically loaded by Next.js

## Testing Email Functionality

After setting up the environment variables:
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/advisory-session`
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. Check your email for the advisory session request
5. Check the client's email for the confirmation

## Troubleshooting

- Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are correct
- Make sure you're using App Password, not regular password
- Check Gmail security settings
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Google account

### Form not submitting?
