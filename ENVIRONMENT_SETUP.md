# Environment Setup Instructions

## Create .env.local file

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory with the following content:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Phone Number
PHONE_NUMBER=+919818735258

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Celeste Abode

# Database (if needed in future)
# DATABASE_URL=your-database-url

# Analytics (if needed)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your-google-analytics-id
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Email Configuration (Gmail)
- **EMAIL_USER**: Your Gmail address (e.g., yourname@gmail.com)
- **EMAIL_PASS**: Your Gmail App Password (16-character password, NOT your regular Gmail password)
- **ADMIN_EMAIL**: Email where form submissions will be sent (usually same as EMAIL_USER)

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup
1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (required for App Passwords)
3. Go to Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
4. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device
5. Generate a new 16-character app password
6. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces) and use it as EMAIL_PASS
7. **Important**: Use the App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password

### 3. Phone Number
- Update PHONE_NUMBER with your business phone number
- Format: +919818735258 (with country code)

### 4. Website Configuration
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL**: Your website URL
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME**: Your website name

## Important Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Restart your development server after creating the file
- All environment variables are automatically loaded by Next.js

## Testing Email Functionality

After setting up the environment variables:
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/advisory-session`
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. Check your email for the advisory session request
5. Check the client's email for the confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?
- Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are correct
- **CRITICAL**: Make sure you're using Gmail App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password
- Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Google account
- Verify the App Password was generated correctly (16 characters, no spaces)
- Check that EMAIL_USER is your full Gmail address (e.g., yourname@gmail.com)
- Make sure the App Password hasn't been revoked or regenerated
- Check Gmail security settings to ensure "Less secure app access" is not blocking (though App Passwords should bypass this)

### Form not submitting?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check network tab for API call status
